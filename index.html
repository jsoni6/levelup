                <h2>Customer Service</h2>
                 <p>Why and How: Have you ever sat through an entire meeting and once it ended you had no idea what just happened or what the main focus of the whole meeting was about? Well if you have then that is a prime example of the wrong way of effective communication. When communicating the whole point of the conversation is to convey an idea to a person or group. Without this skill any type of pitch you give to anyone is practically useless. So over the course of this lesson we will learn to communicate effectively in a short and simple manner. During this lesson there will be a lot of class participation and demonstrations and the class will be able to come up with their own scenarios and show them to the class. Each demonstration of the scenarios will be assigned a problem and each group must demonstrate an incorrect way to handle the problem and then demonstrate the correct way they handled the problem. After each demonstration each group must explain the changes they made to correctly handled/solved the problem. Students may also provide feedback and ask questions to the way the situations are handled and how they went about making their decisions. </p>

                <h2>Thank You note</h2>
                 <p>Why and How: When preparing a Thank You Note include a Header, Intro, Body paragraph, Closing paragraph, Closer and the Endings.  This will help the student learn the fundamentals to a Thank You Note and set the foundation before and after the Interview. The Video will consist of real world examples and their effectiveness. This will help the student self-identify with the teachings and their importance. Along with a video, for a more hands on feel.</p>

                 <h2>Nouns and Pronouns</h2>
                 <p> Nouns and Pronouns is important, because of the fact we use it every day. So you would need to know how to use it properly when communicating with others or typing/writing. In the video I will be walking you through the meaning of nouns and pronouns on the white board. While giving examples on the side of the definition. Also explaining when and where to use them for. Going around pointing out nouns or pronouns that you can use for that person, place, or thing. </p>

                 <h2>Home Network</h2>
                 <p>Learning how to setup a home network is very important, because it will make it easy for you to understand what does what. Also easy for you to figure out why your internet is running slow. Plus being able to understand the importance of how your home network works. Also figuring out what is the most appropriate home network for you. Which is why I made this video that will give you a better understanding of what is what. You will be viewing me going throughout my own home showing you visually and verbally explaining the hardware on what it do. Before I give an explanation, I would like to will ask to test your knowledge on the items on the screen. Also will be giving an quiz at the end of the video to test what you’ve learned. </p>
